- 🖼️ Image generation integrated into the chat flow (when using supported GPT models)
- 📎 File upload support (images, PDFs, text files, and code files)
- 🔒 Privacy-first: all data stored client-side in your browser
- 🎨 Light and dark themes
- 💾 Persistent chat history via IndexedDB
- 🔢 Live token counting with model-aware limits
- 📱 Responsive design

### Prerequisites

- Node.js >= 24.x (npm >= 11.x recommended)
- Azure Subscription with:
  - Azure AI Foundry access
  - Deployed model(s) (GPT-4.1, GPT-5, GPT-5.1, GPT-5.2, o-series, Claude 4.5, DeepSeek)
  - API key and endpoint

## Getting Started

1. **Clone and install**

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/cu-cit-cloud-team/azure-openai-gpt-chat.git
   cd azure-openai-gpt-chat
   npm install
   ```

2. **Configure environment**

   ```bash
   cp .env.local.example .env.local
   # Edit .env.local with your Azure AI Foundry credentials and deployment names
   ```

3. **Run development server**

   ```bash
   npm run dev
   # Visit http://localhost:3001
   ```

**Using DevContainer:** Open in VS Code with Dev Containers extension - dependencies install automatically.

## Configuration

This app uses Azure AI Foundry-style endpoints and a single API key for OpenAI, Anthropic, and DeepSeek models. Environment variables are validated on each chat request; missing variables will cause a clear error indicating which values are required.

### Core Azure configuration

Required environment variables (see `.env.local.example` for the canonical list):

- `AZURE_FOUNDRY_ENDPOINT` – Your Azure AI Foundry endpoint, e.g.:
  - `https://your-deployment-name.services.ai.azure.com`
- `AZURE_FOUNDRY_RESOURCE_NAME` – Your Azure AI resource name (used by the SDK client)
- `AZURE_FOUNDRY_API_KEY` – API key used for all deployed models (OpenAI, Anthropic, DeepSeek)

> **Important:** Use your **deployment names**, not raw model IDs, for all `*_DEPLOYMENT` variables.
>
> For example, if you deployed a model as `my-gpt-5-chat`, set `AZURE_OPENAI_GPT5_CHAT_DEPLOYMENT="my-gpt-5-chat"`, even though the base model is `gpt-5.1-mini`.

### Azure OpenAI (GPT and o-series)

The chat route maps UI model names (e.g. `gpt-5.1`) to specific deployment environment variables via `modelDeploymentMap` in `app/api/chat/route.ts`.

Key environment variables:

- GPT-4.1 / GPT-5 family:
  - `AZURE_OPENAI_GPT41_DEPLOYMENT`
  - `AZURE_OPENAI_GPT41_MINI_DEPLOYMENT`
  - `AZURE_OPENAI_GPT41_NANO_DEPLOYMENT`
  - `AZURE_OPENAI_GPT5_DEPLOYMENT`
  - `AZURE_OPENAI_GPT5_MINI_DEPLOYMENT`
  - `AZURE_OPENAI_GPT5_NANO_DEPLOYMENT`
  - `AZURE_OPENAI_GPT5_CHAT_DEPLOYMENT`
  - `AZURE_OPENAI_GPT5_CODEX_DEPLOYMENT`
  - `AZURE_OPENAI_GPT51_DEPLOYMENT`
  - `AZURE_OPENAI_GPT51_CHAT_DEPLOYMENT`
  - `AZURE_OPENAI_GPT51_CODEX_DEPLOYMENT`
  - `AZURE_OPENAI_GPT51_CODEX_MINI_DEPLOYMENT`
  - `AZURE_OPENAI_GPT51_CODEX_MAX_DEPLOYMENT`
  - `AZURE_OPENAI_GPT52_DEPLOYMENT`
  - `AZURE_OPENAI_GPT52_CHAT_DEPLOYMENT`

- o-series:
  - `AZURE_OPENAI_O3_DEPLOYMENT`
  - `AZURE_OPENAI_O3_MINI_DEPLOYMENT`
  - `AZURE_OPENAI_O4_MINI_DEPLOYMENT`

- Image generation:
  - `AZURE_OPENAI_GPT_IMAGE_DEPLOYMENT` – Image model used for image generation inside chat (e.g. `gpt-image-1.5`).

If a model is selected in the UI but the corresponding deployment variable is not set, the API will return an error similar to:

> `No deployment configured for model: gpt-5.1. Please set the AZURE_OPENAI_GPT51_DEPLOYMENT environment variable.`

### Anthropic (Claude 4.5 via Azure)

Anthropic models are accessed through Azure AI Foundry using the same key and endpoint, but with a different API path and deployment names.

- `AZURE_ANTHROPIC_API_PATH` – e.g. `/anthropic/v1/`
- `AZURE_ANTHROPIC_API_VERSION` – e.g. `2023-06-01`
- `AZURE_ANTHROPIC_CLAUDE_HAIKU_45_DEPLOYMENT` – deployment for `claude-haiku-4-5`
- `AZURE_ANTHROPIC_CLAUDE_OPUS_45_DEPLOYMENT` – deployment for `claude-opus-4-5`
- `AZURE_ANTHROPIC_CLAUDE_SONNET_45_DEPLOYMENT` – deployment for `claude-sonnet-4-5`

### DeepSeek (via Azure)

DeepSeek models are also accessed through Azure AI Foundry with their own API path:

- `AZURE_DEEPSEEK_API_PATH` – e.g. `/models/`
- `AZURE_DEEPSEEK_R1_0528_DEPLOYMENT` – deployment for `DeepSeek-R1-0528`
- `AZURE_DEEPSEEK_V31_DEPLOYMENT` – deployment for `DeepSeek-V3.1`
- `AZURE_DEEPSEEK_V32_DEPLOYMENT` – deployment for `DeepSeek-V3.2`

DeepSeek models support rich reasoning output, and this app uses AI SDK middleware to extract reasoning segments tagged with `<think>`.

### Supported models

The canonical list of supported models and token limits lives in `app/utils/models.ts`. Broadly, the app supports:

- **GPT-4.1 / GPT-5 family**: `gpt-4.1`, `gpt-4.1-mini`, `gpt-4.1-nano`, `gpt-5`, `gpt-5-mini`, `gpt-5-nano`, `gpt-5-chat`, `gpt-5-codex`, `gpt-5.1`, `gpt-5.1-chat`, `gpt-5.1-codex`, `gpt-5.2`, `gpt-5.2-chat`
- **o-series**: `o3`, `o3-mini`, `o4-mini`
- **Anthropic (Claude 4.5)**: `claude-haiku-4-5`, `claude-sonnet-4-5`, `claude-opus-4-5`
- **DeepSeek**: `DeepSeek-V3.1`, `DeepSeek-V3.2`, `DeepSeek-R1-0528`

Refer to `app/utils/models.ts` and `.env.local.example` to ensure your deployments and environment variables are configured consistently.

### Upgrading from earlier versions

Several recent releases updated environment variable names and added support for Anthropic and DeepSeek models. If you are upgrading from an earlier beta:

1. Copy the latest example file:

   ```bash
   cp .env.local.example .env.local
   ```

2. Copy your existing values into the new `.env.local`, paying attention to renamed or newly added variables.

3. Restart the dev server; if any required variables are missing, the chat API will log and return a clear error listing them.

## API & Architecture

The main chat endpoint lives at `app/api/chat/route.ts` and is implemented using the Vercel AI SDK v6.

- Uses `streamText` with `smoothStream()` for real-time streaming responses.
- Converts UI messages via `convertToModelMessages`.
- Streams responses back to the frontend using `toUIMessageStreamResponse`.
- Attaches message metadata (model name, timestamp) and usage metadata (`totalUsage`) per response.
- Routes models to providers via:
  - `createAzure` for OpenAI (GPT and o-series)
  - `createAnthropic` for Claude models
  - `createDeepSeek` wrapped with `extractReasoningMiddleware` for DeepSeek models

> **Runtime:** The chat API currently uses the **Node.js runtime** (`export const runtime = 'nodejs'`), not the Edge runtime.

### Error behavior

The API converts low-level errors to user-friendly messages:

- Missing deployment / misconfigured model → "Model deployment not found. Please contact your administrator."
- Quota issues → "API quota exceeded. Please try again later."
- Authentication issues → "Authentication failed. Please contact your administrator."
- Any other unexpected error → "An error occurred processing your request. Please try again."

Full error details are logged server-side with model name and timestamp for easier debugging.
